# OfficeDIrectory
Here is my proposed solution for the "Office directory"

The project is done entirely in Kotlin and the selected architecture is MVVM clean.

Used technologies:

Api communication - Retrofit2, Okhttp3 DI- Hilt ViewBInding Coroutines LiveData Unit testing - JUnit4, mockk and google truth Material.
Errors: Method displays error in toast Possible improvements: can handle all error

Better use of theme features (Dark and Light themes are almost the same now). Landscape and portrait both supported with accessibility. Thank you for your time!
